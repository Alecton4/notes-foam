### `CMD` & `ENTRYPOINT`

From Phind:

> The `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions in a Dockerfile serve similar purposes in that they both specify what command should be run when a container is started from the image. However, there are some key differences between the two:
>
> 1. **Overriding**: The command specified with `CMD` can be easily overridden by specifying a different command at the end of the `docker run` command. On the other hand, the command specified with `ENTRYPOINT` cannot be overridden in this way (it can only be overridden by specifying a new `ENTRYPOINT` in the `docker run` command with the `--entrypoint` flag).
>
> 2. **Combining `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`**: If both `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` are used in the same Dockerfile, `CMD` will be used as arguments to `ENTRYPOINT`. For example, if your Dockerfile has `ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]` and `CMD ["app.py"]`, the command that will be run when a container is started from the image is `python3 app.py`.
>
> 3. **Form**: `ENTRYPOINT` has two forms: the exec form (which is `ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]`) and the shell form (which is `ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2`). The exec form does not invoke a command shell which means it does not do variable substitution. The shell form does invoke a command shell which means it does do variable substitution.
