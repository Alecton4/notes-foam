# Install openSUSE Tumbleweed (20230715) on ideapad S10-2

## Hardware specs

- CPU: i686

## Before installation

1. Download the ISO image from [the official site](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/#download). Note that the images for installation and live OS are different.
2. Create a live USB stick. I used SUSE Studio Imagewriter on openSUSE Tumbleweed.

## During installation

Refer to [the official Leap startup guide]( https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/startup/html/book-startup/art-opensuse-installquick.html#sec-opensuse-installquick-install ) and [the community guide]( https://opensuse.github.io/openSUSE-docs-revamped-temp/yast_installer/ ) for more. Below are a few notable points.

### Text mode

Due to the old hardware, select text mode using boot time using `F3`.

### Network settings

Do **not** configure the network during installation.

### Disk

Below is my configuration:

- A new separate partition for `swap` which size supports hibernation.
- A new separate partition for `/`.
- A new separate partition for `/home`.

### Installation settings

No need to install many packages during installation. We can install them later.
