## Start service

Before running Virtual Machine Manager, enable related services via the following commands:

```bash
systemctl start libvirtd.service
```

The following alias can be set for convenience:

```bash
alias vstart='sudo systemctl start libvirtd.service && systemctl status libvirtd.service && sudo virsh net-start default && sudo virsh net-list --all && virt-manager'
```

## Virtual networks

At the time of writing (*Tumbleweed 20230118*), first disable WARP then enable WARP.

## Shared directory

### Linux guest

1. Enable shared memory:

   ![Enable shared memory](attachments/shared_mem.png)

2. Add hardware:

   ![Add hardware](attachments/add_hw.png)

   Then edit XML as follows:

   ```xml
   <filesystem type="mount" accessmode="passthrough">
     <source dir="HOST_SHARE_PATH"/>
     <target dir="GUEST_SHARE_PATH"/>
     <driver type="virtiofs"/>
   </filesystem>
   ```

   Note that for old distro having kernel version lower than *Linux v5.4* (e.g. *Ubuntu 16.04*), `9p` should be used instead of `virtiofs`. Supported FS could be checked via the following commands:

   ```bash
   cat /etc/filesystems
   cat /proc/filesystems
   ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/fs
   ```

3. Mount the shared directory within the guest operating system via the following commands:

   ```bash
   mkdir -v ~/shared
   sudo mount -t virtiofs GUEST_SHARE_PATH ~/shared
   ```

### Windows guest

## GPU passthrough

- Set `vfio-pci.ids=10de:1fb8` in the boot parameter.

## Looking Glass

### Build client

#### Prerequisite

Use `sudo zypper install binutils-devel make cmake fontconfig-devel libSDL2-devel libSDL2_ttf-devel spice-protocol-devel libX11-devel libnettle-devel wayland-protocols-devel libconfig-devel libXi-devel libXss-devel libwayland-egl-devel nettle` to install prerequisites.

Here is the output on my machine:

```text

Resolving package dependencies...

The following 6 packages are going to be upgraded:
  cmake cmake-full libX11-6 libX11-data libX11-devel libX11-xcb1

The following 12 NEW packages are going to be installed:
  glu-devel libconfig-devel libnettle-devel libSDL2_ttf-2_0-0 libXss-devel Mesa-libGLESv1_CM-devel Mesa-libGLESv2-devel nettle
  SDL2-devel SDL2_ttf-devel spice-protocol-devel wayland-protocols-devel

6 packages to upgrade, 12 new.

Then I encountered this issue:

```text
