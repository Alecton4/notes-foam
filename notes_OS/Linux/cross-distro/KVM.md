# Kernel-based Virtual Machine Usage

For installation, see:

- [[Tumbleweed/dev_env#KVM]]

## Start service

Before running Virtual Machine Manager, enable related services via the following commands:

```bash
systemctl start libvirtd.service
```

## Virtual networks

At the time of writing (*Tumbleweed 20230118*), first disable WARP then enable WARP.

## Shared directory

1. Enable shared memory:

   ![Enable shared memory](attachments/shared_mem.png)

2. Add hardware:

   ![Add hardware](attachments/add_hw.png)

   Then edit XML as follows:

   ```xml
   <filesystem type="mount" accessmode="passthrough">
     <source dir="HOST_SHARE_PATH"/>
     <target dir="GUEST_SHARE_PATH"/>
     <driver type="virtiofs"/>
   </filesystem>
   ```

   Note that for old distro having kernel version lower than *Linux v5.4* (e.g. *Ubuntu 16.04*), `9p` should be used instead of `virtiofs`. Supported FS could be checked via the following commands:

   ```bash
   cat /etc/filesystems
   cat /proc/filesystems
   ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/fs
   ```

3. Mount the shared directory within the guest operating system via the following commands:

   ```bash
   mkdir -v ~/shared
   sudo mount -t virtiofs GUEST_SHARE_PATH ~/shared
   ```
