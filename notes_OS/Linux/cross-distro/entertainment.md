### Tips

- You may want to run the game on NV card.
  - See [[Tumbleweed/tweak#Make applications run on NVidia card]].
  - After updating system's native driver, the driver in flatpak should also be updated before running the game.
- To make it run without window frame, add a rule in *System Settings* >> *Window Management* >> *Window Rules*:
