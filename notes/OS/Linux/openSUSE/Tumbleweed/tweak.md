```bash
sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
sudo zypper addrepo https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode VSCode
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper install code
```

#### CUDA

Add *CUDA* repo (refer the [the post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/openSUSE/comments/gaihe9/cuda_on_tumbleweed/ )) by the following commands:

zypper addrepo -p 100 http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/opensuse15/x86_64/cuda-opensuse15.repo
```

#### M17N (Multilingualization)

Add *M17N* repo by the following commands:

```bash
zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/M17N/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/M17N.repo
```

#### Flatpaks

```bash
sudo zypper in flatpak
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```
